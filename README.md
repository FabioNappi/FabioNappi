# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FabioNappi/FabioNappi/master/wave.gif" width="50px">
## Who I am
I am Fabio Nappi, a Computer Science Engineering student @ Politecnico di Milano. I'm a cybersecurity lover :heart_eyes:, but still very interested in anything a :computer: can do.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Master's thesis: an Intrusion Detection System for Automotive. The repository will be public as soon as I graduate.
